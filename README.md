# curious-miner
A game using a kivy/python for the game interface and an arduino uno compatible dev-kit<br/>
A game where you can mine when you travel to new places(just move anywhere lol) using the digikey kit. The display will have like a small graphic with directions and distance to the nearest mine spot. you can press a reset button if it's not possible(like it's asking you to go in a sewer or something).
